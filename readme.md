# Build a Grammar Correction Python App with Gramformer and Gradio

My grammar sucks at the best of times. 

Enter Gramformer.

Gramformer is a deep learning model built using Transformers and PyTorch that allows you to improve your grammar. It takes a malformed sentence as an input and returns a sentence with corrected grammar. 

What's even better is that it's easy to get up and started with and the creator is adding on a grammar highlighter and error detector as well! Anyway, we'll go through it all in the vid! 

In this video you'll learn how to: 
1. Install Gramformer
2. Use the Gramformer model for grammar correction 
3. Deploy it as an application using Gradio
