# Gramigo - a Grammar Correction App with Gramformer and Gradio

Trying to save some bad-grammared people at my best using Gramformer package.

Gramformer is a deep learning model built using Transformers and PyTorch that allows you to improve your grammar. It takes a malformed sentence as an input and returns a sentence with corrected grammar. 

What's even better is that it's easy to get up and started with and the creator is adding on a grammar highlighter and error detector as well! 

Schedule: 
1. Install Gramformer
2. Use the Gramformer model for grammar correction 
3. Deploy it as an application using Gradio

Happy coding!
